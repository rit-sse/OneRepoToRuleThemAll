SSE Constitution
================

Mission Statement
-----------------
The Society of Software Engineers (SSE) is a student organization dedicated to
fostering academic and professional success. Its focus is on four fundamental
pillars: mentoring, networking, projects, and events. Through these aspects,
the Society strives to build relationships with all students, the department,
other organizations, and the institute.

Non-discrimination Policy
-------------------------
It is the shared belief amongst members of the SSE that discrimination on the
basis of sex, race, age, gender, sexual orientation/identity, personal
preferences, or any other factor is not acceptable. The members of the Society
commit to upholding tolerance and respect of all people regardless of their
lifestyle or background.

Code of Conduct
---------------
As active members of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) community, advocates
of software engineering, and future workers in the computing industry, the Society's
members are expected to demonstrate the highest levels of personal and professional conduct.  

At the core of all efforts as Society members, we will:
* Demonstrate civility, respect, decency and sensitivity towards our fellow
  members of the RIT community.
* Conduct ourselves with the highest standards of moral and ethical behavior.
  Such behavior includes taking responsibility for our own personal choices,
  decisions and academic and professional work.
* Affirm through the daily demonstration of these ideals that RIT  is a university
  devoted to the pursuit of knowledge and a free exchange of ideas in an open and
  respectful environment.

Conduct prohibited by these policies is unacceptable in both the SSE facilities, as
well as any related setting, such as off-campus social events.

Reporting an Incident of Harrassment or Discrimination
------------------------------------------------------
The SSE encourages prompt reporting of all percieved incidents of discrimination, 
harassment, or retaliation, regardless of the offender's identity or position. It is
the duty of all SSE Officers to report any incidents immediately via the preferred 
mechanism of the university or the SE department. 

Pillars of the Society
----------------------
The Pillars of the Society describe the organization's foremost priorities. The
Pillars do not directly map to committees -- all actions taken by the Society
should reflect these priorities and improve the Society within these areas.

The Pillars shall be valued equally, and are listed here in no particular
order.

### Mentoring
The Society shall promote the academic success of members of the RIT community,
with a focus on material related to Software Engineering.

### Networking
The Society shall maintain relationships with prospective employers, sponsors,
students, alumni, and important members of the computing industry.

### Projects
The Society shall provide students with the opportunity to improve their
engineering and creative skills in a non-academic setting.

### Events
The Society shall provide opportunities to promote friendship and fellowship
within the organization.


Membership
----------
### Active Membership

#### Rights
Active members of the Society are permitted to vote in elections, start and
sign petitions for the removal of officers, propose appeals, and are granted any 
other rights or responsibilities determined by the Primary Officers.

#### Requirements
Active membership shall only last for one academic term and must be re-earned
each academic term the candidate wishes to be considered a member. Candidates
who have been considered active members for a given academic term shall be
considered active members for the first two weeks of the following term. This
grace period shall allow for the acquisition of membership without the loss of
any benefits.

A candidate must satisfy all of the following requirements to be an active
member: 

1. The candidate must be enrolled as a student at RIT in Henrietta, New York,
   United States.
2. The candidate must make at least one significant contribution to the
   betterment or continuation of the Society. The details of a "significant
   contribution" shall be determined by the current Primary Officers' Policy.

Students who are active members in the term prior to participating in co-op,
study abroad, other student learning opportunities, medical leave, or other
justified absence from campus as determined by a majority vote of the Primary
Officers, shall maintain their membership status for the duration of their
time away.

### Alumni Membership

#### Rights
Alumni members of the SSE are not permitted to participate in votes, elections,
or petitions. All other rights shall be determined by the Primary Officers.

#### Requirements  
Alumni membership shall last indefinitely after acquisition unless directly
contested. A candidate must satisfy all of the following requirements to have
Alumni membership. 

1. The candidate must not be enrolled as a student at RIT in Henrietta, New York,
   United States.
2. The candidate must have earned Active membership while at RIT.
3. The candidate must have applied for alumni membership within six months of
   leaving RIT. Alumni membership can also be granted after the six month
   time period upon approval of the Primary Officers. The Officers' Policy shall
   specify the application process for Alumni membership.


### Temporary Membership

#### Rights
Temporary members of the SSE are not permitted to participate in votes,
elections, or petitions. These members shall not be included in any count of
the Society's members for the purposes of voting, elections, or petitions. All
other rights shall be determined by the Primary Officers.

#### Requirements
Temporary membership may be granted for at most one academic term at the
discretion of the Primary Officers if the following additional requirements are
met:

1. The candidate must be enrolled as a student at RIT in Henrietta, New York,
   United States.
2. The candidate must not ever have had a Temporary, Active, or Alumni
   membership in the Society.


### Removal of Membership

All forms of membership may be contested at any time by the Primary Officers.

Membership may be removed only by a vote among the Primary Officers. Should a
Primary Officer feel a member is not acting in the spirit of the SSE
Constitution and its ideals, it is the responsibility of the Primary Officer to
start a discussion with the other Primary Officers detailing the nature of the
member's actions and reasons for removal of membership. This discussion shall
be concluded with a vote among the Primary Officers for or against the
placement of the candidate on a probationary period, the length of which shall
be determined at the discretion of the Primary Officers based on the nature of
the candidate's behavior. Should a decision in favor of probation be reached,
the candidate shall be informed of the verdict and their probationary period
shall begin. Should this not be reached, the candidate shall be informed of the
nature of the discussion.

At the end of the probationary period, a second discussion shall be held
between the Primary Officers and the candidate detailing the improvement of the
candidate during their probationary period. This discussion shall be concluded
with a vote among the Primary Officers for or against the removal of membership
from the candidate. If the officers vote in favor of removal, the candidate
shall be informed of the verdict and be removed from the membership roster
immediately. The former member shall also be barred from obtaining membership
for a minimum of the remainder of the current academic term.

The probationary period may be skipped if the Primary Officers come
to a unanimous decision to skip probation and proceed directly to the removal
of the membership. This final clause should only be used in truly extraneous 
circumstances with a reasonable effort to include the member in the discussion.


Governance
----------
The collection of Primary Officers and Committee Heads, referred to as
officers, is responsible for the initiation and execution of ideas and
discussions that further the goals of the Society.

### Primary Officers
The Primary Officers are leaders elected by the Society's members to direct the
organization. Detailed responsibilities for each position shall be recorded in
the Primary Officers' Policy.

#### Positions

##### President
The President is responsible for directing the progress of the Society. As the
leader of the organization, they are responsible to see that the society
improves and progresses over the course of their presidency.

##### Vice President
The Vice President's responsibilities shall support the president and their
goals as they pertain to the Society.

##### Secretary
The role of the secretary shall record the events and occurrences of the
Society. They are responsible for the documentation of all useful knowledge
accumulated throughout their term. In addition, the Secretary is responsible to
see that necessary parties have easy and constant access to relevant
information.

##### Treasurer
The treasurer is responsible for all financial matters that happen on behalf of the
SSE. As such, they must grant members the permission to use SSE funds, ensure
all financial transactions are recorded properly, oversee merchandise sales and distribution,
and see that funds and items purchased are used in a responsible way. 

#### Period of Office
For annual elections, the period of office begins at the end of the spring
academic term. For any other elections, the period of office begins
immediately. Periods of office conclude at the end of the spring academic term
in the year for which the officer serves. Officers who no longer meet the
candidacy requirements for office must resign.

#### Impeachment
Primary officers may only be impeached by the completion of a petition started by
an active member of the Society. The petitioner must provide their reasoning
for impeachment before receiving signatures.
Should a petition receive two thirds of the signatures of all active members,
it may be presented to the Primary Officers or to the Academic Advisor
to begin the impeachment process. The Primary Officer in question may not interfere or
delay this process in any way, nor can they operate in their position during this time.

The Officer in question will then have the opportunity to form a defense to 
the claims, which must be made accessible to all active members. After one week,
a vote must be held amongst the members to determine if the Officer should be removed.
If two thirds of all active members vote to impeach, the Primary Officer shall be removed from their position immediately. 
Following the removal of the Primary Officer, a vote shall be held to fill 
the vacant position. In the time between the removal of the officer and the 
appointment of the new officer, all responsibilities of the removed Primary Officer 
shall be completed by the remaining Primary Officers.

#### Resignation
Primary Officers may resign at any point during their period of office. Upon
resignation, the officer is stripped of the powers, rights and responsibilities
of the position. Before the next election occurs, all responsibilities of the
vacant position shall be fulfilled by the remaining Primary Officers. 


### Committees
Committees may be formed to delegate responsibility for tasks within the
Society. The internal structure of committees shall be specified in the Primary
Officer's Policy. Committee Heads shall be appointed by Primary Officers, and
shall be listed in the Primary Officers' Policy each year. No committee may
have more than one Head at any time.

#### Committee Heads
Committee Heads are leaders that handle tasks and responsibilities related to a
specific committee of the Society. It is the duty of all Committee Heads to 
promote the values held by the SSE and to represent the organization in an
appropriate mannor. The responsibilities and goals of each Committee Head 
are also listed in the Primary Officers' Policy.

Committee Head appointments terminate with the period of office of the primary
officers who chose them.

#### Committee Head Impeachment
Committee heads may be removed by the Primary Officers for failing to fulfill
the responsibilities of their position. The Primary Officers may vote to place
the Committee Head on a probationary period, the length of which should be
determined based on the nature of the Committee Head's behavior. Should a
decision be reached, the candidate shall be informed of the verdict and the
probationary period shall begin.

At the end of the probationary period, a discussion shall be held among the
Primary Officers addressing behavior during the probationary period. The
Primary Officers must make a reasonable effort to include the Committee Head in
this discussion. This discussion shall be concluded with a vote among the
Primary Officers for or against the removal of the candidate from their
position; should a decision be reached, the candidate shall be informed of the
verdict and removed from the position.

The probationary period may be skipped if and only if the Primary Officers come
to a unanimous decision to skip probation and proceed directly to the removal
of the Committee Head. This final clause should only be used in truly
extraneous circumstances with a reasonable effort to include the Committee Head
in the discussion.

#### Resignation
Committee Heads may resign at any point during their period of office. Upon
resignation, the head is stripped of the powers, rights and responsibilities of
the position.


Primary Officer Elections
-------------------------
Elections for Primary Officers shall be held each year at the end of the Spring
term (annual elections) and at any time when an Officer position is left
unfilled. Only one member can occupy any elected position at a time.

### Candidacy and Eligibility
Candidates for Primary Officer roles in the Society must meet the following
requirements by the start of the term in which they would take office:

Position        | Year level    | Prior involvement
----------------|---------------|------------------
President       | 4             | 2 academic terms
Vice President  | 3             | 1 academic term
Treasurer       | -             | 1 academic term
Secretary       | -             | - 

“Year level” is counted by the lower of [A] years enrolled at least part-time in a
higher-education institution post high school graduation, or [B] by credits obtained
at RIT following the scale published by RIT's Office of the Registrar.

“Prior Involvement” refers to the number of complete academic terms during which the
candidate served as a Primary Officer or Committee Head. In the event a candidate has
not previously served as a Primary Officer or Committee Head, two complete academic terms
during which the candidate served as a Mentor with the society may be substituted to serve
as one term of “Prior Involvement”. No more than one term of “Prior Involvement” earned
through mentorship may be substituted as the requirements for any office.

All Primary Officers must be enrolled as Software Engineering students at RIT in Henrietta,
New York, United States and not be on co-op during the term in which they would serve.

Candidates for President and Vice President must both plan to remain enrolled
and on-campus for the entire academic year for which they are to serve.
Candidates for Secretary and Treasurer must both plan to remain enrolled and
on-campus for at least the most immediate academic term for which they are to
serve.

In an event where all candidates for President and Vice President are the same,
only a single vote for President needs to be held, with the individual who recieved
the second highest amount of votes becoming Vice President.

### Collection and Acceptance of Nominations

#### Position Nominations
The nomination of elected position candidates must begin and end at least 48
hours before elections are held. Any currently active member of the society can
nominate eligible students for any electable position. Alumni members cannot
submit nominations for Primary Officers.

#### Nomination Notification/Acceptance
All members of the Society that are nominated for an elected position must be
notified of the nomination within 24 hours of their nomination in a written or
electronic form. Acceptance or rejection of the nomination must then be made,
either in written or electronic form, up to 24 hours before elections are held.
In the event that a nominated candidate does not respond to a nomination
notification within the time period, the nominated candidate will no longer be
considered eligible for the position for the ongoing election process.

An up-to-date list of all accepted nominations must be made public and easily
accessible.

### Election Process
The election process for Primary Officers utilizes an instant-runoff voting
system, where each nominee is ranked from 1 (most desired) to N (least
desired), where N is the total number of nominees running for each position. In
the event that a nominee is not ranked on a ballot, they will be considered to
be ranked in last place (N) for that voter.

At the end of the voting period, the first choice vote for all voters is
tallied. The candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated from the
running. The votes are then re-tallied. Voters who selected a candidate who has
been removed from the running instead use their next most favorable candidate.
This process repeats until only one candidate remains. This remaining candidate
shall be considered the winner.    

In the event that one or more nominees have an equal sum ranking, the nominee
with the highest average ranking is considered the winner. In the event that
both the sum and average rank is equal, another vote consisting of the tied
nominees will take place. This process repeats until a tie no longer exists.

Any active member of the Society can vote for an elected officer. Alumni or
temporary members cannot participate in this process.

Committee Head Selection
------------------------
### Eligibility
Any student enrolled at RIT in Henrietta, New York, United States
during the term in which they would serve may be nominated to be a Committee Head.
Members cannot serve in Committee Head and Primary Officer positions concurrently.

### Nomination Process
Nominations for Committee Heads may be held for any vacancy. Nominations should
be held immediately after the Primary Officers' election at the end of each
academic year. Any member may submit nominations for Committee Heads. All
candidates must accept a nomination before they are selected for the position.
In the event of a Commitee Head resignation or removal, the Primary Officers may
reopen nominations at any point during the semester to fill the vacancy.

### Selection
Committee heads are selected for a term by the Primary Officers who will be
serving during the same term.


Voting Procedures
-----------------
### Primary Officers
Unless otherwise stated, all voting among Primary Officers shall occur by
consensus, that is, that all Primary Officers must agree to proceed with a
particular course of action. Any Primary Officer may request a vote for any
issue presented to the officers.

### General Voting
A simple majority of the Primary Officers may initiate a binding majority vote
of the members of the Society. The size of the majority shall be decided by the
Primary Officers and must not be lower than 50%. Eligibility to vote, as well
as eligibility to count towards the voting collective, is determined by the
type of membership each member holds.


Meetings
--------
### General Meetings
The officers of the Society must make a reasonable effort to hold a general
meeting of the Society at least once per week throughout each academic term.
General meetings need not be held during weeks where final exams are taking
place.

The time and location of general meetings must be made readily and publicly
available.

### Officer Meetings
A formal meeting of the officers, led by the President, shall occur once a week
for the purpose of openly discussing and resolving ongoing issues within the
Society. Meeting minutes for each Officer Meeting shall be made publically
available within 72 hours of the start of the Officer Meeting.


Policies
--------
Officers in the Society must publish a policy that specifies the rules,
policies, and structure for the part of the Society under their governance for
the year.  The policy may be modified at any time.  All policies must be made
freely available to Society members for review.

### Primary Officers' Policy

The Primary Officers of the Society are required to maintain a Primary
Officers' Policy document that defines the specific structure, goals, and rules
of the Society for the year. This document may be adopted from the previous
year's Primary Officers, or can be rewritten to meet the needs of the Society.
Any powers, rules, or regulations not specified in this document may be
clarified through the Primary Officers' Policy.

### Financial Policy

The Financial Policy is an independent document from the Primary Officers'
Policy and is created and maintained by the Treasurer of the Society. The
purpose of the Financial Policy shall define procedures to help the Treasurer
maintain clear and complete records of financial transactions that occur within
the society. The Financial Policy also defines plans for how to handle problems
that directly affect the financial procedures of the Society.

### Policy Conflict
In the event of any conflicts of policies (with respect to external documents)
exist, the policy with the most recent modification date shall be chosen in
favor of the older one. If in the event that the Constitution conflicts with
any other external document, the policy or policies listed in the Constitution
take precedence.


Advisors
--------
Department-appointed advisors to the SSE, if they exist, have the right to vote
in elections for Primary Officers.


Amendments
----------
Any Active member of the Society may propose an amendment to this constitution at any point, 
to be voted on during the next applicable election period. If deemed nessecary by the 
Primary Officers and approved by the department advisor(s), the voting procedure can be held at 
any point during the semester.

### Mandatory Public Forum Period
The process of drafting an amendment shall be at the discretion of the author. 
The final text for the amendment must be presented in writing to a club advisor 
or primary officer no later than one week prior to the vote opening. All proposed 
amendments to be included in a general election must be made available in public 
view for a public forum allowing comments. The forum must be 
moderated by the Primary Officers, ultimately managed by the Secretary. 

It is recommended, but not required, that amendment authors consult a primary officer 
or Club Advisor prior to proposal.

### Voting Procedure
For all semantic changes, no fewer than two-thirds of the votes must approve the ratification
amendment, with a minimum of two-thirds of the Society participating in the vote. Modification 
to the SSE Constitution that does not affect the meaning of the document can be approved by a 
concensus vote amongst the Primary Officers.


The amendment ballot must include:
 * The final text of the amendment
 * A prompt indicating that an “Approve” vote will amend the Constitution with the proposed additions and removals indicated here; a “Reject”  vote will not change the current text of the Constitution.
 * An option to select exclusively “Approve” or “Reject”

Academic advisors may choose to require the inclusion of an interpretation of the proposed amendment also be included on the ballot. This must be indicated clearly as the opinion of the department on the topic, as supplementary information.

All amendments added to this constitution shall override and overrule any and all statements within this document prior to the addition date of the amendment.

The new or continuing Primary Officers must implement changes in the organization in accordance with the amendment by the start of the following semester.

### Amendment-Only Elections
In a semester in which no primary officer positions require an election, and amendments have been proposed by the tenth week of classes, an amendment-only election must be run. The process for this is at the discretion of the Primary Officers.

Appeals
-------
Decisions made by the Primary Officers in regards to the Primary Officer Policy or constitutional interpretation
may be contested at any point by an active member of the SSE in good standing. To initiate an appeal, the member must create 
a report detailing the proposed appeal in a way that is readily accessible to the members of the SSE. To present the appeal, it must 
first have the approval of either two Primary Officers or one third of the current Committee Heads 
as well as the Department Advisor. A vote shall then be held amongst all Officers and the Department Advisor 
to determine if the appeal shall be implemented. The vote shall be determined by a 2/3rds majority.
